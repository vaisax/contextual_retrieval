Introduction
This guide outlines best practices for software development at ACME, emphasizing quality, security, and efficiency. Following these principles ensures scalable, maintainable code and reduces technical debt.

1. Version Control
- Use Git with GitFlow branching strategy: main for production, develop for integration, feature branches for new work.
- Commit messages: Use conventional commits (e.g., "feat: add user authentication").
- Require pull requests (PRs) with at least two approvals and automated tests passing.
- Tag releases semantically (v1.2.3).

2. Code Quality and Standards
- Language: Python 3.10+, follow PEP 8 style guide.
- Linting: Integrate Black for formatting, Flake8 for style, and MyPy for type checking.
- Documentation: Use Sphinx for API docs; every function/module must have docstrings.
- Refactoring: Schedule bi-weekly sessions to address code smells using SonarQube analysis.

3. Testing
- Unit Tests: Aim for 85% coverage with pytest. Mock external dependencies.
- Integration Tests: Test API endpoints with requests library; use Docker for isolated environments.
- E2E Tests: Selenium for UI flows; run in CI/CD pipeline.
- TDD: Apply for core business logic; write tests before code.

4. Security Practices
- Authentication: Use OAuth2/JWT; never store plain passwords (use bcrypt).
- Input Validation: Sanitize all user inputs with libraries like bleach; prevent SQL injection via parameterized queries.
- Vulnerability Scanning: Weekly scans with OWASP ZAP and Snyk.
- Secrets Management: Store in HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager; never commit to repo.

5. CI/CD Pipeline
- Tools: GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automation.
- Stages: Lint -> Test -> Build -> Deploy -> Smoke Test.
- Infrastructure as Code: Use Terraform for provisioning; Ansible for configuration.
- Blue-Green Deployments: Minimize downtime with zero-downtime releases.

6. Performance and Monitoring
- Profiling: Use cProfile for bottlenecks; optimize hot paths.
- Caching: Redis for session data; CDN for static assets.
- Monitoring: Prometheus for metrics, ELK Stack for logs, Grafana for dashboards.
- SLAs: Maintain 99.9% uptime; alert on response times >500ms.

7. Collaboration and Agile
- Daily Standups: 15-min syncs via Zoom.
- Sprints: 2-week cycles with Jira for tracking.
- Code Reviews: Focus on logic, not style (handled by linters).
- Knowledge Sharing: Bi-monthly tech talks and wiki updates.

Conclusion
Adopting these practices fosters a culture of excellence. Review and update this guide annually. For questions, contact devops@acme.com.

Abstract
This paper analyzes the profound impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems, focusing on rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification. Data from 1950-2023 shows that 73% of marine species have shifted poleward at rates of 70 km/decade, disrupting food webs and fisheries yields. We propose adaptive management strategies to mitigate these effects.

Introduction
Since the industrial revolution, atmospheric CO2 levels have risen 50%, leading to ocean temperatures increasing by 0.33°C on average. This warming, combined with acidification (pH drop of 0.1 units), threatens coral reefs, shellfish, and fish populations. The study covers Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, using satellite data and field observations from 500+ monitoring stations.

Methodology
We employed species distribution models (SDMs) using MaxEnt software, incorporating variables like sea surface temperature (SST), salinity, and oxygen levels. Dataset includes 2,000+ species from IUCN Red List and OBIS database. Statistical analysis via R with generalized linear models (GLMs) assessed migration patterns and biodiversity loss.

Results
- Temperature Rise: SST increased 1.2°C in tropical waters since 1980, causing coral bleaching events in 85% of reefs.
- Species Migration: Tropical fish like clownfish expanded 15% into temperate zones; cold-water species (e.g., cod) declined 20% in native ranges.
- Ecosystem Shifts: Phytoplankton blooms altered, reducing primary productivity by 6% in high-latitude oceans. Fisheries catch in the North Atlantic dropped 12% due to cod migration.
- Acidification Effects: Shellfish calcification rates fell 30%, impacting commercial species like oysters and mussels.

Discussion
These changes cascade through food chains, with top predators like sharks facing prey scarcity. Economic impacts include $10B annual losses to global fisheries. Vulnerable regions: Small Island Developing States (SIDS) where 90% of protein comes from fish.

Policy Recommendations
1. Establish marine protected areas (MPAs) in migration corridors.
2. Implement dynamic fisheries quotas using real-time SDM predictions.
3. International agreements to reduce black carbon emissions targeting ocean warming.
4. Invest in resilient aquaculture and alternative proteins.

Conclusion
Urgent global action is needed to limit warming to 1.5°C as per Paris Agreement. Without intervention, marine biodiversity could lose 20-30% of species by 2100. Future research should focus on resilience mechanisms in keystone species.
